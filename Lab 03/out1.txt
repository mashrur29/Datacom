The 20-year-old skipped training on Thursday amid reports he has agreed to join the Catalan side, but their bid has been knocked back
Borussia Dortmund have confirmed that they have rejected an offer from Barcelona for Ousmane Dembele.
Barca have long been linked with a move for the 20-year-old winger, but have acted on their interest after selling Neymar to Paris Saint-Germain for 222 million, with some reports stating Dembele has already agreed to the move.

Although the German side's sporting director, Michael Zorc, insisted no deal has been struck, speculation increased on Thursday when coach Peter Bosz revealed Dembele missed training and that the club could not contact him.
Shortly afterwards, an announcement was released revealing that negotiations had taken place, but a deal is "not currently likely".
